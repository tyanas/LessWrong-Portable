<h1>Joy in the Merely Real</h1>
<p  style='text-align: center;'> ❦
</p>
<blockquote>
<p  style='line-height: 1.7;'> … Do not all charms fly<br />At the mere touch of cold philosophy?<br />There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:<br />We know her woof, her texture; she is given<br />In the dull catalogue of common things.
</p>
<p class='blockquote_byline'> —John Keats, <em>Lamia</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Nothing is “mere.”
</p>
<p class='blockquote_byline'> —Richard Feynman
</p></blockquote>
<p>You’ve got to admire that phrase, “dull catalogue of common things.” What is it, exactly, that goes in this catalogue? Besides rainbows, that is?
</p>
<p>Why, things that are mundane, of course. Things that are normal; things that are unmagical; things that are known, or knowable; things that play by the rules (or that play by <em>any</em> rules, which makes them boring); things that are part of the ordinary universe; things that are, in a word, <em>real</em>.
</p>
<p>Now that’s what I call setting yourself up for a fall.
</p>
<p>At that rate, sooner or later you’re going to be disappointed in <em>everything</em>—either it will turn out not to exist, or even worse, it will turn out to be real.
</p>
<p>If we cannot take joy in things that are merely real, our lives will <em>always</em> be empty.
</p>
<p>For what sin are rainbows demoted to the dull catalogue of common things? For the sin of having a scientific explanation. “We know her woof, her texture,” says Keats—an interesting use of the word “we,” because I <a class='wikilink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/FakeReductionism'>suspect that Keats didn’t know</a> the explanation himself. I suspect that just being <a class='wikilink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/ScienceAsCuriosityStopper'>told that someone else knew</a> was too much for him to take. I suspect that just the notion of rainbows being scientifically explicable <em>in principle</em> would have been too much to take. And if Keats didn’t think like that, well, I know plenty of people who do.
</p>
<p>I have already remarked that nothing is <em>inherently</em> <a class='wikilink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/MysteriousAnswersToMysteriousQuestions'>mysterious</a>—nothing that actually exists, that is. If I am <a class='wikilink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/ProbabilityIsInTheMind'>ignorant</a> about a phenomenon, that is a <a class='createlinktext' rel='nofollow'
    href='https://www.readthesequences.com/Reductionism101Sequence/MindProjectionFallacy?action=edit'>fact about my state of mind</a><a rel='nofollow'
    class='createlink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/Reductionism101Sequence/MindProjectionFallacy?action=edit'>?</a>, not a fact about the phenomenon; to <a class='wikilink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/ExplainWorshipIgnore'>worship</a> a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious is to worship your own ignorance; a blank map does not correspond to a blank territory, it is just somewhere we haven’t visited yet, etc., etc…
</p>
<p>Which is to say that <em>everything</em>—everything that <em>actually</em> exists—is liable to end up in “the dull catalogue of common things,” sooner or later.
</p>
<p>Your choice is either:
</p>
<ul><li>Decide that things are allowed to be unmagical, knowable, scientifically explicable—in a word, <em>real</em>—and yet still worth caring about;
</li><li>Or go about the rest of your life suffering from existential ennui that is <em>unresolvable</em>.
</li></ul><p>(Self-deception might be an option for others, but <a class='wikilink' href='https://www.readthesequences.com/DoublethinkChoosingToBeBiased'>not for you</a>.)
</p>
<p>This puts quite a different complexion on the bizarre habit indulged by those strange folk called <em>scientists</em>, wherein they suddenly become fascinated by pocket lint or bird droppings or rainbows, or some other ordinary thing which world-weary and sophisticated folk would never give a second glance.
</p>
<p>You might say that scientists—at least <em>some</em> scientists—are those folk who are <em>in principle</em> capable of enjoying life in the real universe.
